- 👋 Hi, I’m @drchristallant
- 👀 I’m interested in programming languages of all kinds, but specifically JS, C#, and CSS for front end development positions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to polish up my JavaScript learning from being away for so long.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything exciting and challenging. Gaming has always been a passion, however brain teasers are amazing!
- 📫 How to reach me: email DrChrisTallant@gmail.com or twitter @tallant_chris (warning, lots of protest/human rights posts.)
